<h1>About</h1>
<h2>About the Model</h2>
<p>Like in case of all other things we believe in the saying simple is always the best. As such we have taken a Time-Series approach for forecasting the COVID-19 Pandemic.
We have used an ARIMA model to predict the COVID-19 Cases for the next few months and the model will be updated on a daily basis.
ARIMA, short for ‘AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average’, is a forecasting algorithm based on the idea that the information in the past values of the time series can alone be used to predict the future values.  Any ‘non-seasonal’ time series that exhibits patterns and is not a random white noise can be modeled with ARIMA models.<br><br>
ARIMA takes into consideration the recent changes in data with more priority than the data say a month ago and as such, it works pretty well in forecasting COVID-19 Cases it has proven to forecast the Cases for the next 7 days with an error rate of +/-5%. Since the model is intended to be used for Short-term forecasts, It is not intended that this would be used for long-term predictions, as it is certainly not as sophisticated as complex epidemiological models.<br><br>
 Historical Performance & Baseline Comparison<br>
  Late June US Projection<br>
  Late May Projections</p><br>

<h2>Data Source and Forecasts</h2>
<p><i><strong>Our source:</strong></i> Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India(MofW), Updates their database every day with accurate and confirmed data whose figures are being reconciled with ICMR short for Indian Council of Medical Research, New Delhi.<br>
For any further information on MoFW, you can reach them through the following mail address: technicalquery.covid19@gov.in</p><br>
<p><i><strong>Forecasts:</strong></i> Forecasts for each Indian State, India as a country and the World will be updated on a daily basis and the model will be trained each on the recent changes in the data to accommodate all the real-world factors that affect the outcome of the forecasted cases which cannot be factored into the model.</p><br>
<h2>Assumptions</h2>
<p>Confidence Intervals</p><br>
<h2>Limitations</h2>
<p>We want to be as clear as possible regarding what our model can and cannot do. While we try our best to make accurate forecasts, no model is perfect. Here we present some of the known limitations of our model.</p><br>
<p><i><strong>Data Accuracy:</strong></i> A model is only as good as the data we feed it. If the data is not accurate, then it would be difficult to make accurate projections downstream.</p><br>
<p><i><strong>Lockdown fatigue / holidays:</strong></i> As per our analysis of the lockdown relaxation related impacts, an increasing number of people have been moving around in the weeks following a lockdown. This may contribute to an increase in infections in the weeks following the lockdown relaxation. Similarly, holidays & group activities specifically those without social distancing are a source of “superspreader” events, which we currently do not explicitly incorporate –This can be seen directly reflected in the graphs as a sharp spike following the opening of Lockdowns in each state where the actual confirmed cases overshadow the forecasts cases.</p><br>
<p><i><strong>Data frequency:</strong></i> Because our model uses only the daily case counts from each region to make forecasts, forecasts for those regions with minimal data (less than 1-2 weeks) or those regions with stagnant data such as regions with no new cases in the past few weeks cannot be forecasted.</p><br>
<p><i><strong>Day-of-week factors:</strong></i> We currently do not account for day-of-week factors in cases reported. i.e Cases reported on Sunday/Monday are about 60% of that of Tuesday-Thursday. So we expect on average that our projections will be higher than Sunday/Monday reports and lower than our Tuesday-Thursday reports. Also sometimes due to region & local restrictions there are delays in cases reported on a day which is added to the account of next day this is currently not considered in the model assumptions and for training as it is not possible to accurately identify the actual number of cases that were delayed in a day.</p><br>
<p><i><strong>Maximum Forecastable Timeline:</strong></i> Since this is a simple data dependent model the maximum rationally considerable forecasts for this particular subject is 30-31 days.</p><br>
<p><i><strong>End date:</strong></i> We are only making projections for 30-31 days/ 4-5 weeks ahead, but this does not mean that the epidemic will stop afterwards. Reported Cases may continue to rise even after we stop making projections. We currently plan on keeping the model updated on a daily basis until a cure has been found and the COVID-19 Pandemic ends.</p><br>
